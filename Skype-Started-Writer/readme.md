Problem - 
  Due to Corona virus outbreak, we are suggested to work from home. During the lockdown we were advised to put a message in the team skype group that you've started working. Something basic like "Started!". Sometimes (Several times) I forgot to do the same. 
  
Solution - 
  So, here is a very basic 20lines code that writes started for me in a random time between 9:30 and 9:50 AM. 
  
Requirements - \n
  skpy \n
  getpass
